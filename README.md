## Summary
I utilize a list of addresses to locate the corresponding Redfin web pages and retrieve essential information pertaining to the apartment's market status and estimated price. This scalable approach can be applied to real estate operations, ensuring that the status of every apartment of interest remains up-to-date. The advantage of this approach is that it eliminates the need for Selenium, offering a cost-effective and low-risk methodology that relies on Google Search, Request, and Beautiful Soup. With this method, I have not encountered any issues related to potential page lockouts, which are often a concern when using Selenium.
